check section validity in commands file
=======================================
- prev_subsection = null
- sub_sections = split file by FILTER / ACTION / ORDER (non case-sensitive)
- set flag has_action=false
- for each sub_section
  - lines = split subsection by \n
  - subsection name match the previous one by logic (err7). then update prev_subsection=subsection
    (logic:  null>FILTER, FILTER>ACTION, ACTION>ORDER/FILTER, ORDER>FILTER)
  - commands_num=0
  - switch subsection_name (lines[0])
    - FILTER
      - subsection name match the previous one by logic.
      - for each line (lines[1..n]):
        - if comment - skip
        - commands_num++
        - conditions = split line by ' '
        - for each condition
          - check validity (condition) (err4,err5)
      - check commands_num>0

    - ACTION
      - subsection name match the previous one by logic.
      - for each line (lines[1..n]):
        - if comment - skip
        - commands_num++
        - check validity (line) (err4,err5,err6)
      - check commands_num>0

    - ORDER
      - subsection name match the previous one by logic.
      - for each line (lines[1..n]):
        - if comment - skip
        - commands_num++
        - check validity (line) (err4,err5)
      - check commands_num<=1

    - default
      - incorrect sub-section name (err3)
- check has_action=true (err7)
